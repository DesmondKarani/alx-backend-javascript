# ES6 Data Manipulation Project

## Overview

This project involves using ES6 features for data manipulation, including arrays and various data structures like Sets and Maps.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:
   ```sh

- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint checks.
- `npm run full-test`: Run both ESLint and Jest tests.

## Usage

Ensure all functions are exported and end all files with a new line. Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project.

## Learning Objectives

- Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays.
- Understand typed arrays.
- Utilize Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures.
